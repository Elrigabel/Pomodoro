# Pomodoro

## What is the Pomodoro Technique ?
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s (Wikipedia)</br>
The goal of this technique is to reduce interruptions on focus. It is aimed for efficient work with two intervals, usually 25 minutes of work and short breaks.</p>

## How does it work ?

<p>With the start button on the left, the timer run with 25 minutes of work by default. When the work time finishes, it changes automatically to break time set on 5 minutes by default.</br>
If you want your own settings, you can click on the right button, to set a new timer. A little window appear, where you can choose your work time and break time, and validate your settings by click on the button on the bottom. </br>
Once your timer is running, it doesn't stop by itself. When you want it to end, click on the stop button, that will reset the timer.</p>
